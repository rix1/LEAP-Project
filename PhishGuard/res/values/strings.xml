    <string name="android_security">
        A central idea in Android security is that no application, by default,
        has permission to perform any operations that would adversely impact other applications, the operating system, or the user.
        That is why you grant an application permissions upon install. But this step are often ignored, or accepted because lets face it -
        "We really need this app!". When you\'re connected to the Internet, applications can send whatever information they want to wherever they want.
        Phishguard provides users the ability to monitor not only which applications that are making outgoing connections,
        but at what time they do it, and how much data they send out. In future versions, the application will even have the ability to block unwanted outgoing traffic!
