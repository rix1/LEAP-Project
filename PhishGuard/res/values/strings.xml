        A central design point of the Android security architecture is that no application, by default,
        has permission to perform any operations that would adversely impact other applications, the operating system, or the user.
        This includes reading or writing the user\'s private data (such as contacts or emails), reading or writing another application\'s
        files, performing network access, keeping the device awake, and so on.
